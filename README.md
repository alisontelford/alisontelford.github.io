# Alison Telford's personal stats and R knowledge bank

If you've navigated your way to my page, welcome! This is where I store all my knowledge of stats and R for my own future reference, like an external computer brain if you will. Feel free to make use of these pages yourself, you may find something useful :)

## About Me
I obtained my PhD in statistics at the University of Leeds in 2019 and have worked as a Biostatistician for ~4 years. Throughout my undergraduate, PhD and work as a Biostatistician I have used and honed my coding skills in R. I also play badminton and am an avid runner.
